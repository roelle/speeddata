WLNK: R_eff = 1.00 (no dependencies, self-contained claim). No external evidence chains. Bias check: Developer-centric approach - may prioritize flexibility over operational simplicity. Risk: Reference implementations could diverge from library, creating maintenance burden. Deployment model unspecified - punts critical decisions.
